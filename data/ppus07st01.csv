"Note:  Jail counts are for June 30, and prison counts are for December 31. Probation and parole counts for 2000-2006 are January 1 counts from the next reporting year because some agencies update their data. The 2007 probation and parole counts are for December 31. Jail and prison counts include inmates held in private facilities. Estimates were rounded to the nearest 100.  ",,,,,,,,,,,
"a/Includes offenders on probation and parole. Because some offenders may have multiple statuses (i.e., held in a prison or jail but remain under the jurisdiction of a probation or parole authority) totals in 2000-04 exclude probationers held in jail or prison; totals in 2005-06 exclude probationers and parolees held in jail or prison; and the total in 2007 excludes probationers and parolees held in jail or prison, probationers who were also under parole supervision, and parolees who were also under probation supervision. For these reasons, details do not sum to total.",,,,,,,,,,,
b/Totals include some offenders held in a prison or jail but who remained under the jurisdiction of a probation or parole agency. ,,,,,,,,,,,
